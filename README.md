# Keyworder
GRU Speech recognition for Raspberry Pi

Run pretrained model to recognize "Alina" word with 97% accuracy or train model for your dataset

### Scripts
[`list_input_device.py`](https://github.com/FyodorLikhachev/Keyworder/blob/main/list_input_devices.py) — to list all available microphones

[`main.py`](https://github.com/FyodorLikhachev/Keyworder/blob/main/main.py) — to run pretrained model in real-time

[`train.py`](https://github.com/FyodorLikhachev/Keyworder/blob/main/Train.py) — to train new gru model

### Change train configuration
For now all constants are hardcoded in file [`constants.py`](https://github.com/FyodorLikhachev/Keyworder/blob/main/constants.py). Argument parsing is coming soon!

### Constants
You would like to modify this constants for you

**For model**

`INPUT_SIZE` — input size for model

`HIDDEN_SIZE` — hidden layer size in PyTorch.GRU

`OUT_SIZE` — number of classes

**For audio data**

`RATE` — number of records in Hz

`WINDOW_TIME` — window size in seconds

`CHANNEL_NUMBER` — number of audio channels

**For live listening**

`CHUNK_SIZE` — audio stream size per one read

`MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH` — max number of chunks you can send to the model

`MODEL_FILE` — directory to model file

`SENSITIVITY` — keyword recognition threshold. If number of ones in a row is greater than this constant then it's considered a keyword

`INPUT_DEVICE_INDEX` — microphone index for live speech recognition. To get your mic index use [`list_input_device.py`](https://github.com/FyodorLikhachev/Keyworder/blob/main/list_input_devices.py)

`DEVICE` — device you will use (cpu/gpu/tpu)

**For training**

`EPOCH` — number of epochs

`LR` — learning rate for adam

`TRAIN_DATA_PERCENTAGE` — percentage of training data. Cannot be greater than 1

`TRAIN_KEYWORD_MARKER` — how many windows to check for ones

**For labeling data**

`KEYWORD_MARKER_NUMBER` — number of ones at the end of the word

### Visualize metrics
To visualize model loss and accuracy uncomment lines in [`train.py`](https://github.com/FyodorLikhachev/Keyworder/blob/main/Train.py) and use jupyter notebooks
